# Local test - can we see the app ourselves as the host?
curl -X POST -F "fasta=@example.fasta"  http://localhost:24624/run_alignment

# Restart the host system
sudo systemctl daemon-reload
sudo systemctl restart flask_app.service

# Check to make sure the app is running without any errors
sudo systemctl status flask_app.service

# The directory ./tmp is REQUIRED - this is where jobs are physically ran. 
# The flask_app.py is what's being run in the background and is used as the connection point between the world and us here in rime.
# mmseqs_alignment.sh is the script that actually does the alignments. This is executed by flask_app.py
# connect_history.log is my best attempt at logging who connects to us when
# run.log is all the output and "gunk" that mmseqs generates when it runs
